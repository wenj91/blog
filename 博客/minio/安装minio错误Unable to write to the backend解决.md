Expected Behavior
-----------------

Add the option `-v /mnt/data:/data` to the `docker run` command to have minio saving data to host directory.

Current Behavior
----------------

Minio cannot write to data directory because of permission error.

    Created minio configuration file successfully at /root/.minio                                                                                                                                                 
    ERROR Unable to initialize backend: Unable to write to the backend.                                                                                                                                           
          > Please ensure Minio binary has write permissions for the backend.
    

Possible Solution
-----------------

I am probably doing something stupid; solution is to point out the obvious thing I'm missing.

Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
-----------------------------

Starting with the simplest case.  
Create folder on host where data will reside:

    sudo su
    mkdir /mnt/data
    chmod -R 777 /mnt/data
    

Run a new docker container:

    docker run -p 9000:9000 --name minio1 \
      -v /mnt/data:/data \
      minio/minio server /data
    

Result:

    Created minio configuration file successfully at /root/.minio                                                                                                                                                 
    ERROR Unable to initialize backend: Unable to write to the backend.                                                                                                                                           
          > Please ensure Minio binary has write permissions for the backend.
    

Context
-------

I just want to move from the super-toy example of spinning up a minio docker container to the somewhat toy example of binding the minio /data directory to the host /mnt/data directory.

Your Environment
----------------

*   Version used : minio/minio:latest docker image
*   Docker host: `centos-atomic-host 7.1805`

For Project Atomic you can also set append :z or :Z to the have SElinux allow writing to the container: docker run -p 9000:9000 --name minio1 \\ -v /mnt/data:/data:z \\ minio/minio server /data More info at: https://www.projectatomic.io/blog/2016/03/dwalsh\_selinux\_containers/ \_Originally posted by @eco-minio in https://github.com/minio/minio/issues/6237#issuecomment-410351496\_
