# [Install Elasticsearch on macOS with Homebrew](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.8/brew.html)

Install Elasticsearch on macOS with Homebrewedit
Elastic publishes Homebrew formulae so you can install Elasticsearch with the Homebrew package manager.

To install with Homebrew, you first need to tap the Elastic Homebrew repository:

brew tap elastic/tap
Once youâ€™ve tapped the Elastic Homebrew repo, you can use brew install to install the default distribution of Elasticsearch:

brew install elastic/tap/elasticsearch-full
This installs the most recently released default distribution of Elasticsearch. To install the OSS distribution, specify elastic/tap/elasticsearch-oss.
